## Background
The increasing abuse of image editing softwares, such as Photoshop and Meitu, causes the authenticity of digital images questionable. Meanwhile, the widespread availability of online social networks (OSNs) makes them the dominant channels for transmitting forged images to report fake news, propagate rumors, etc. Unfortunately, various lossy operations, e.g., compression and resizing, adopted by OSNs impose great challenges for implementing robust image forgery detection, as shown in the below figure.

  <em>The detection results of DFCN (TIFS 2021) and ours by using an original forgery and the forgery transmitted through OSN. The left girl in the forgery is spliced (forged).</em>
</p>

To fight against the OSN-shared forgeries, in this work, a novel robust training scheme is proposed. We first conduct a thorough analysis of the noise introduced by OSNs, and decouple it into two parts, i.e., *predictable noise* and *unseen noise*, which are modelled separately. The former simulates the noise introduced by the disclosed (known) operations of OSNs, while the latter is designed to not only complete the previous one, but also take into account the defects of the detector itself. We then incorporate the modelled noise into a robust training framework, significantly improving the robustness of the image forgery detector.

  <em>A qualitative comparison for the detection of OSN-transmitted forgeries. For each row, the images from left to right are forgery (input), ground-truth, detection result (output) generated by MT-Net (CVPR 2019), NoiPri (TIFS 2020), ForSim (TIFS 2020), DFCN (TIFS 2021) and ours, respectively. The forgeries in each group from top to bottom are the cases without OSN transmission, and with Facebook, Weibo and Wechat transmissions, respectively.</em>

## Dependency
- torch 1.6.0
- tensorflow 1.8.0

## Usage

For testing:
```bash
python main.py
```
Then the model will detect the images in the `data/input/` and save the results in the `data/output/` directory.
